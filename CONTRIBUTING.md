# Contributing

We are accepting PR's!

We don't care about age or experience.
If you have any ideas for a feature, contact one of the contributors and we will help you develop it.

## Reporting Issues Process

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Rails**, and instead refer to [security policy](https://rubyonrails.org/security/).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/00198216/FindMyProduct_BackEnd/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. 
  Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, 
  and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Pull Request Process

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted. 
* Write test cases for the new feature. If all tests are passing, that's enough to propose your contribution.
* Do not forget document your code.

## Code of Conduct

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
